Recall for a moment the section on sound and perception. In that section we mentioned that the range of human hearing runs from about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Since humans can’t actually hear frequency content above 20,000 Hz, frequencies above this limit are actively removed from most audio and music signals before they are sampled. Given what we now know about the Sampling Theorem, you won’t be surprised to hear that the most common sampling rate for audio and music signals is around 40,000 Hz, or twice the highest audible frequency.2
